Heart disease encompasses a spectrum of medical conditions that impact the functioning of the heart. The incidence of heart disease is on the rise, primarily due to escalating stress levels.

As per data from World Health Organisation (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have emerged as the leading global cause of mortality. The diseases claim a staggering 17.9 million lives annually, accounting for approximately 31% of all worldwide fatalities.


Problem Statement:

The healthcare team at XYZ's Doctor of Health Hospital is keen on integrating Data Science into their operations. Given the alarming surge in heart disease cases, their primary focus lies in leveraging existing data to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease.


Dataset description:
1. id: Unique id for each patient
2. age: Age of the patient in years
3. origin: place of study
4. sex: Gender (Male of Female)
5. cp chest pain type: (typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal, asymptomatic)
6. trestbps resting blood pressure: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
7. chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl
8. fbs: if fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
9. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (normal, stt abnormality, lv hypertrophy)
10. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
11. exang: exercise-induced angina (True or False)
12. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
13. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
14. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
15. thal: (normal, fixed defect, reversible defect)
16. num: predicted attribute
